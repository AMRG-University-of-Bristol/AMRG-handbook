# Our Handbook

We are working with researchers to build `Our Handbook`: a research group staff handbook template materials to help you use it. 
We hope research group leaders and members will work together using these resources to:
- build a healthy, inclusive, enjoyable research culture in their group 
- produce the most ethical and rigorous research possible

Please see [our website](https://very-good-science.github.io/our-handbook) for the most up-to-date and detailed information about the project.
