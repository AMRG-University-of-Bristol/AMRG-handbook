# Research Handbook
This is a Jupyter Book template for a research group handbook.

The purpose of this repo is to provide a starting point for group leaders who want to create an environment in which:
* Everyone knows how to access the available help and support
* Expectations (for group leaders and group members) are explicit
* Group members have agency to impact the research culture of the group
* Potential future group members can get a flavour of the research culture
* It's easy to welcome people to the team 
* Everyone knows who to go to to ask all kinds of questions, and where to find important documents

Your handbook can be used for as many or as few of these purposes as you like, but it should be a living document, which the group authors together.

## How to use
### 1\. Make your own copy this repo
* Fork the repo (if your group doesn't have a GitHub organisation, perhaps make one and fork to there).
* Make all members of your team collaborators of the forked repo

### 2\. Edit the book with your team
* Clone the forked repo locally
* Set up an away day, a hack day, or a series of team meetings where you edit the book together - detailed suggestions and guidance for what to edit and how to run the sessions [here](editing-guide.md)!
<!-- TODO: Make a guide to handbook hack days: preparations for organisers, instructions for members, etc, i.e. install VS code, add jupyterbook plugin, etc - and link here  see our [guide to handbook hack days](hack-day.md)-->

### 3\. Make your handbook available online
* Follow the instructions [here]() to make your handbook available online.
* Make sure that you link to the handbook on your group website, and in any job (including PhD studentship) openings.
* Please tell us if you use this handbook! 

### 4\. Keep the book updated
#### 4A. Onboard new team members using the handbook when they join
* Show them around the handbook and the current expectations for group members.
* Show them how to edit the handbook, and ask them to edit themselves in to the team members section (using the instructions for new members page).

#### 4B. Review the book 
* Review the book as a team regularly (we suggest once per year). Set aside a session at an away day or a team meeting to do this. This is an opportunity for the team to share new expertise that they've learned in the last year, and to decide as a group to adapt new group-wide policies or processes.
* Review the book with team members individually (we suggest every 6 months for new staff, or once per year for others). This is an opportunity to check that the groups research culture is working for everyone.
