### Co-working

## Estimating time needed for work
When planning timescales for the future work, remember to factor in time for:
- Holidays and sick days.
- A post-mortem of the project (which will help you with accurately estimating future projects).
- 

If you are planning the time needed to do a technical piece of work that you haven't done before:
- Get a second opinion from someone who does this kind of work
- Factor in time for learning
