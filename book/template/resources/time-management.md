# Time management

Although you may be primarily working on 1-2 main research projects/papers, these can have many different aspects:
<!-- Choose all that apply -->
- Reading
- Admin
- Programming
- Testing
- Documenting
- Community-building
- Writing
- Speaking engagements
- Networking

And you are also encouraged to take part in:
<!-- Choose all that apply -->
- Teaching
- Mentoring
- Outreach
- Open Source contributions
- Side projects

Time management and prioritisation can help you to use your time and energy as wisely as you can.

## Choosing goals 
<!--Link to official review system-->
Thinking about career and project goals can be a useful time-management tool as it can help you to prioritise work.
We have an official review system in place to look at these goals every <TIMEFRAME>, but we can also use group meetings or one-to-one sessions to discuss goals and priorities.
  
### SMART goals
[SMART goals](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/smart-goals/) are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timed.
They can apply to invidiual projects or career goals.

For example, you might want to:
- Apply to 3 fellowships by the end of the year.
- Send 15 emails to advertise your study survey by the end of the month.

## Prioritising work
It's simply not possible to say yes to all requests.
The following tools can help you decide which to say yes to:
<!-- Keep tools/practices that you and your group think are useful, and add your own-->
- The [Eisenhower matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) is particularly helpful in helping you distinguish between tasks which are important or urgent. It can be useful to decide importance by cross-referencing with your long-term goals/priorities.
  (and cross referencing with your goals/priorities)

### Mental Inventory (https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/mental-inventory)

### Reporting 
Keeping a list of opportunities that you had to say no to. 
These can serve as useful inspiration for applying for funding, or asking for more resource/assistance. 

## Finding time to focus

### Pomodoro technique
The [pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) is a method for working in sets of 25 minute "tomatoes", with 5 minute breaks in between.
It's especially useful for getting started on something

### Co-working

## Estimating time needed for work
When planning timescales for the future work, remember to factor in time for:
- Holidays and sick days.
- A post-mortem of the project (which will help you with accurately estimating future projects).
- 

If you are planning the time needed to do a technical piece of work that you haven't done before:
- Get a second opinion from someone who does this kind of work
- Factor in time for learning
