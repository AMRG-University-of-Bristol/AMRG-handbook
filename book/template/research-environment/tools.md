# Tools

```{hint}
Use this section to explain your philosophy regarding the use of third-party tools.
This might be "we all use this tool", "use whatever tool you like" or somewhere in between.

By tools, we mean things like:

- Programming languages
- Version control
- Document creation and sharing tools
- Communication and meetings platforms
```

There are a wide variety of tools that we use our day-to-day activities.
We are flexible and allow everyone to use the tools that work best for them,
but at the same time we recognise that it can be helpful to have an agreed set of tools that as a minimum, everyone will use.

## Tools that we use as a team

The following are the minimum set of tools that we ask everyone in the group to be familiar with.

```{hint}
We have added some initial examples in this section,
but you should discuss with your group and agree which tools work best for everyone,
then modify as appropriate and add links to your specific workspaces or network.
```

### Communication tools

For text messaging:

- We use [Slack](https://slack.com) for instant messaging within the team
    - Say "hello!" to the team each day
    - Prefer posting things to our communal **#group** channel rather than direct messages
    - Use threads to reply to messages

For online meetings:

- We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) or [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) for calling
    - Switch on video if you are comfortable doing so
- And [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com) or [Miro](https://miro.com) for collaborative whiteboards

### Documents

- We use [Office 365](https://www.office.com) most of our documents
- And store them on our [group SharePoint site](https://www.sharepoint.com), so we all have access to them

### Programming

Some projects necessitate the use of a particular programming language.
When there isn't a specific requirement, we recommend checking our [team profiles](our-team) and choosing something with the greatest overlap.
From experience, this is likely to be either Python or R.

We use Git for version control and make use of our [group organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/jean-golding-institute),
unless a project already has its own repository.

## Guidelines for choosing your own tools

```{hint}
You may have some recommendations for other tools, such as text editors.

There may also be legal or data protection requirements that limit the tools you can use.
```

You are welcome to make use of other tools such as text editors and development environments.

- We suggest you look for free, open source software
- If you're not sure what to use then we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a cross-platform code editor
- When doing data visualisation, we suggest you use a format that allows text and images to be included alongside code to create a narrative document
    - For Python, we suggest creating a Jupyter Notebook using the [jupyterlab package](https://jupyter.org/install.html)
    - For R, we suggest creating [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop)

```{warning}
Avoid storing *data* on third-party cloud services unless all of your project's data is open.
Such services will not necessarily have the same level of security and privacy protection as our official providers.
