#One-to-one Meetings
<!--In order to get the most out of meetings it is useful to outline expectations-->
  
## General guidance
One-to-one meetings should be well organised to maximise the usefulness for both parties. 

For supervisors the aims include ensuring the research is progressing and give guidance `<ADD ANY OTHER IMPORTANT AIMS FOR YOUR GROUP>`. 
Supervisors may also have a duty of care (link to section on well being).

For researchers/students the aims include getting guidance, learning, talking through problems, asking questions and raising issues `<ADD ANY OTHER IMPORTANT AIMS HERE>`.
  
## Responsibilities of supervisors
- Set aside regular time to meet your student/researchers and if possible have recurring meetings put in your calendar
- Make it clear that if your student/researcher wants feedback on work that you need the document at least `<INSERT TIME FRAME, E.G. 5 DAYS>` before the deadline for comments.
- Engage with the one-to-one meeting fully.
Don't work on your emails during the meeting!
- If you have a duty of care, make sure your student/researcher is OK.

## Responsibilities of researchers/students
- Prepare an agenda of topics you wish to cover and send these in advance or list them at the beginning of the meeting
- If you are asking your supervisor to read or comment on a document, specify particular areas that you wish them to focus on or specific questions you want answers to, e.g. "please read Chapter 3" or "does the methods section need elaborating?"
- If you want to discuss something on your computer make sure you have the files ready
The same goes if you want to show them something in the lab
- If you go to your supervisor with a problem, try to also think of a solution
- Your supervisor is a busy person, make sure you use your time with them wisely and that you are fully engaged
