# What to do during a workshop

```{note}
This page will guide you through what will happen on the day of your workshop.
The person organising the workshop should complete the steps on the [before a workshop](./before-a-workshop.md) page,
including forking this template to your own GitHub organisation.
```

During a workshop, you can expect to:

- Decide what you're going to work on
- Spend some time working on your tasks

## Decide what you're going to work on

Discuss and agree what sections should be in your finished handbook

Create issues for each of these, with suggested tasks

Decide on a rough by priority (e.g. “must-have”, “nice-to-have”)

Assign each person a first task

## Spend some time working on your tasks

Work through the issue assigned to you

Make a fork of your organisation's handbook. 

How to create/edit pages

Make new issues as necessary

(Recommended) use a tool like a pomodoro timer to organise your work and breaks
