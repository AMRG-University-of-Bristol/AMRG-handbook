```{note}
This is the deployed version of the `Our Handbook` template. The content you are seeing is part of materials designed to help research groups co-create group handbooks together, and a basic example of how a research group handbook might look. There are many more materials in the [`Our Handbook` template repository]() and in the [Meta-Handbook]() which tells you how to use it.

You can:
- Read more about the project [here]()
- Check out some examples of real group handbooks [here](), [here](), and [here]().
- Find out how to make your own handbook [here]().

## Welcome to `Our Handbook` template

Welcome to the `Our Handbook` template book!

`Our Handbook` is a project creating to help research groups co-create group handbooks using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/). We hope research group leaders and members will work together using these resources to:
* build a healthy, inclusive, enjoyable research culture in their group 
* produce the most ethical and rigorous research possible

We have two sets of resources:
* A template handbook on GitHub: The Our Handbook Template, with a deployed website version using gh-pages (You are here!)
* Instructions to help make the most of the template, in the form of the Meta-Handbook.

## Welcome to the `<GROUP NAME>` Group Handbook

### What our Group does
`<GROUP NAME>` is working with `<COLLABORATORS>` to discover answers to the question "`<FOCUS OF RESEARCH>`?". We have a particular interest in `<SUB-AREA OF RESEARCH 1>` and `<SUB-AREA OF RESEARCH 2>`. Check out our [`<CURRENT PROJECTS>`]() and our [`<RECENT PUBLICATIONS>`]().

### Why do we have a group handbook?
<!-- TODO: Choose the reasons that matter to your group and add your own-->

We have a group handbook to:
- Ensure that everyone in the group can find everything they need easily 
- Share resources with others 
- Introduce ourselves ðŸ‘‹
- Do our project management Openly 
- Be explicit about our roles and responsibilities
- Foster a culture of healthy working 
- Help everyone to feel included in decision making and lab culture (which is why we created this together)
